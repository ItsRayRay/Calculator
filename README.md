# Calculator
The Odin Project calculator project

This is my third project from The Odin Project curriculum, a calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project was to create a fully functional calculator that could perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

One of the challenges of this project was that it was not allowed to save data on local storage. As a result, it took some time to figure out how to get the calculator working without relying on local storage.

Despite this challenge, I was able to successfully create a functional calculator that users can use to perform simple calculations. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with buttons for each arithmetic operation and a display screen that shows the input and output values.

Overall, this project helped me to further develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to check out the calculator and try it out for yourself!
